Mission to see true active teaching made available to all students.

## Previous Experiments

I've collected 350 year 11 maths mock exams and conducted a series of investigations to better understand how large language models can be utilised in an education setting. Please see the [dataset page](Dataset) for the details on this.

### BERT-based classifiers

#### fine-tuning BERT

#### classifier head

### GPT-based inference

#### fine-tuning base GPT-3.0

#### zero/few-shot prompting GPT-3.5
